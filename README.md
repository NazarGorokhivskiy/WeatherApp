# WeatherApp
Simple landing page made with pure HTML/CSS/JS and Bootstrap as the only 3rd party library

## Installation
The project is so simple and awesome that you don't need anything like Node.js or npm packages to install.  
Just download the project and open the **index.html** file in your browser and you are all set!
